# GRAPH DEMO FOR WORD FREQ LISTS (3EARS)

Package with graphs for 3ears stats page. Main entry is index.js, all classes are exported from there.


### Notes:
1. webpack.config.js configured partially as per sugestion from (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45273988/webpack3-jshint-loader-does-not-work/45274620#45274620), rather than the React tutorial vids I have recieved, as the Webpack used there is outdated.
